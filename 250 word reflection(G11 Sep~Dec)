Reflection on experience with python, c, esoteric language

Python:
I personally thought that python was hard for me to understand. It was a lot of new information, as well as logical, creative, and mathematical thinking. However, I started to like this language because once I knew the basic information, I was able to think about the order to create the code that will fulfill my needs.  Also, as we do the 5minute quizzes in class, I found it easier for me to build codes. I really like Python

C:
I found C much more difficult than python because it had more codes that were not in English. I was not able to understand the logic at first, but I soon got used to it because I learned python first. I think for this language, I need a lot of practice because there are more specific codes for C that need to be added to the first and end of each line, and makes it harder for me to understand what each code does.

Esoteric language:
For esoteric language, I thought that there is more humor than practicality. I found it interesting that we can make a language just for the purpose of entertainment. For example, the language that I searched, Shakespeare programming, was only for searching specific scenes on Shakespeare. Although I did not know how to code it out, I was able to think of the process with easy if or for loops and sort of imagining the producing process. I felt that the knowledge I gained from python can be used in multiple ways, and re-recognized the importance of the basics.
