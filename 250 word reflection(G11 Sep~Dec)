Reflection on experience with python, c, esoteric language

Python:
I personally thought that python was hard for me to understand. It was a lot of new information, as well as logical, creative, and mathematical thinking. However, I started to like this language because once I knew the basic information, I was able to think about the order to create the code that will fulfill my needs.
