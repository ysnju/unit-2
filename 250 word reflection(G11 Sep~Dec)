Reflection on experience with python, c, esoteric language

Python:
I personally thought that python was hard for me to understand. It was a lot of new information, as well as logical, creative, and mathematical thinking. However, I started to like this language because once I knew the basic information, I was able to think about the order to create the code that will fulfill my needs.  Also, as we do the 5minute quizzes in class, I found it easier for me to build codes. 

C:
I found C much more difficult than python because it had more codes that were not in English. I was not able to understand the logic at first, but I soon got used to it because I learned python first.
